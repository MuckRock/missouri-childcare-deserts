# Analysis of Missouri child care deserts 

This repository contains data and findings for an ongoing collaboration between MuckRock and The Missouri Indepedent on Missouri's "child care deserts", areas where there are more than three children under the age of 5 for every licensed child care slot or no licensed slots at all.
